**TextBrewer** is a PyTorch-based toolkit for **distillation of NLP models**. 

It includes various distilltion techniques from both NLP and CV, and provides an easy-to-use distillation framework, which allows users to quickly experiment with state-of-the-art distillation methods to compress the model with a relatively small sacrifice in performance, increase the inference speed and reduce the memory usage.
